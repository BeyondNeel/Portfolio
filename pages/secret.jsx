            1. The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer
            somebody else up.
            <br></br>
            2. Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning, and you'll start to
            see a big difference in your life.
            <br></br>
            3. The most wasted of all days is one without laughter.
            <br></br>
            4. A smile is happiness you'll find right under your nose.
            <br></br>
            5. When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, show life that you
            have a thousand reasons to smile.
            <br></br>
            6. Today, give a stranger one of your smiles. It might be the only
            sunshine he sees all day.
            <br></br>
            7. Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so
            much to smile about.
            <br></br>
            8. A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.
            <br></br>
            9. Your smile will give you a positive countenance that will make
            people feel comfortable around you.
            <br></br>
            10. A smile is the light in your window that tells others that there
            is a caring, sharing person inside.
